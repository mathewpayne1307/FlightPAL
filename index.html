        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How are flights logged?</h3>
            <p>
                FlightPAL uses user-initiated start and stop actions to record block times,
                gps location to identify airfield, and configurable defaults for other flight details.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the Flight Monitoring?</h3>
            <p>
                When enabled, Flight Monitoring uses the same functions as normal logging for airfield and other default settings, but Off
                block times and On block times are determined by the app. Using GPS and Motion data, we are able to determine when the
                aircraft transitions from Parked > Taxi > Airborne > (Any Touch and Go's) > Taxi > Parked > Completed. The user has control on if flights are logged
                Off block to On block, or Takeoff to Landing.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I edit my flight entries?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. All logged flights can be reviewed and edited within the app if any
                information needs adjusting.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Where does weather data come from?</h3>
            <p>
                METAR weather data is provided by the NOAA Aviation Weather Center and is
                displayed for informational purposes.
            </p>
